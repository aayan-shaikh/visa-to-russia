                    <div class="answer">
                        A Russian visa is an official authorization issued by
                        the Russian government, permitting a foreign national to
                        enter, transit through, and stay in the Russian
                        Federation for a specific period and purpose. For Indian
                        citizens, this is typically affixed to a page in your
                        passport.

                        We highly recommend Indian applicants apply at least 1-3
                        months before your intended travel date, especially
                        during peak travel seasons or public holidays in India
                        or Russia. While expedited processing options are
                        available, applying early ensures sufficient time for
                        unforeseen circumstances and helps avoid last-minute
                        stress.

                    Our service fee is typically non-refundable in case of a
